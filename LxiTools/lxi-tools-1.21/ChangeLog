Changes since lxi-tools v1.13:

 * Make screenshot plugin only support Rigol DM3068

   Rigol DM3068 is the only DM3000 series digital multimeter that seems to
   have screenshot support.

 * Fix entering interactive mode

   their instruments.

 * Cleanup screenshot plugins

 * Consolidate Rigol DSA plugins into one

   To write screenshot image to stdout simply use '-' as the output

   screenshot image to JPG:

    $ lxi screenshot -a 10.0.0.42 - | convert - screenshot.jpg

Changes since lxi-tools v1.12:

 * Update README

 * Update SSA3000X capture command

 * Add completion for benchmark command

 * Update AUTHORS

 * Fix get_device_id()

   This function was missing a call to lxi_disconnect() which resulted in
   some instruments being left hanging when capturing screenshots.
   Instruments that presumable only allow one active connection.

 * Add benchmark feature

   This benchmark feature is useful if you want to compare the VXI-11
   request/response performance of your instruments.

   By default the benchmark sends 100 SCPI ID requests ("*IDN?" commands)
   to the instrument. For each request it waits for and reads the response.
   When done the resulting request rate is printed.

 * Fix screenshot command when using plugin autodetection

   The wrong timeout value was passed when trying to autodetect which
   screenshot plugin to use.

 * Cleanup

 * Fix Rohde & Schwarz HMO 1000 screenshot plugin

   Fix plugin so that it does not strip off the PNG header of the PNG image
   stream.

   Also, the source files and functions of the plugin is now named more
   explicitly according to the name of the instrument series (HMO 1000).

   rigol-dg4000   Rigol DG4000 series function generator
   rigol-dm3000   Rigol DM3000 series digital multimeter
    rigol-dp800   Rigol DP800 series power supply
   rigol-dsa800   Rigol DSA800 series spectrum analyzer
   rigol-dsa700   Rigol DSA700 series spectrum analyzer

   The code is added on behalf of PeDre from the EEVBlog forum.

 * Add README.md to prettify GitHub page

   The original README is still preserved because it is more readable when
   not reading it via GitHub.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Strip trailing spaces

 * Fix typo

 * Fix grammar and typos



Changes since lxi-tools v1.9:

 * Add support for mDNS/DNS-SD discovery

   Add "--mdns" option which enables the discover command to search for LXI
   devices/services using mDNS/DNS-SD.

 * Fix Siglent screenshot plugins

   Write correct response buffer to file. Improve .regex match expression.



Changes since lxi-tools v1.8:

 * Update README

 * Fix newlines when redirecting to file or terminal

 * Rename --dump-hex to --hex

 * Fix missing error message when no SCPI command defined

 * Update man page

 * Remove --dump-file option

   The correct way to dump response to file is to use pipe output
   redirection. For example:

   lxi scpi --address 192.168.1.210 "*IDN?" > response.txt

   This way it is possible to dump any binary response to file.

 * Fix missing error message when no IP address defined

 * Print errors to stderr

 * Cleanup Siglent SDS1000 plugin name

 * Add Siglent SSA 3000X screenshot plugin

 * Cleanup script examples

 * Correct default SCPI raw/TCP port

   By default use port 5025 as described here:
   http://www.lxistandard.org/About/LXI-Protocols.aspx

   If a different port is needed use the '--raw-port' option.

   Apparently Rigol is not using the recommended port for raw SCPI
   commands.

 * Update descriptions of the plugin options



Changes since lxi-tools v1.7:

 * Update README

 * Add Siglent SDS 1000 screenshot plugin



Changes since lxi-tools v1.6:

 * Update README

 * Cleanup

 * Update .regex for Tektronix plugin

 * Update .regex for R&S plugin

 * Update .regex for Keysight plugin

 * Update man page

 * Embed instrument IP address in screenshot filename

   This helps identify screenshot files when capturing screenshots from
   multiple instruments.

   It also allows simplifying the APIs used by the screenshot plugins.

 * Change option '--model' to '--plugin'

   Lets remove any model vs. plugin confusion and only deal with plugin
   names. Each plugin includes support for one or more instruments models
   as described in the plugin description.

 * Add automatic loading of screenshot plugin feature

   If no screenshot plugin is specified the tool will automatically try to
   select the best plugin by matching the instruments ID string against the
   regular expressions defined in each plugin.

   Each screenshot plugin defines a .regex string entry containing space
   separated regular expressions. Each regular expression is matched
   against the instrument ID string. The plugin with most matches is
   selected.

   Note: This mechanism is slightly slower than manually specifying which
   screenshot plugin because it needs to retrieve the instruments ID string
   first.

 * Improve description of Rigol plugins

 * Fix Rigol 2000 screenshot plugin

   Remove trailing newline in received image data.

 * Add screenshot plugin for Rigol 2000 series

   Also, make existing Rigol plugin only apply for 1000z series.



Changes since lxi-tools v1.5:

 * Add date-time stamp to screenshot filename

 * Improve command handling

   In case of a misspelled command the tool would misleadingly
   respond: "Error: No IP address specified"

   With this fix, it now responds: "Error: Unknown command"

 * Update README

 * Added screenshot plugin for Tektronix 2000 series scopes

 * Improve scpi response output

 * Add --raw and --raw-port options to scpi command

   One can now use choose to use raw/TCP instead of VXI11 when firing SCPI
   commands. Simply append the --raw option like so:

   lxi scpi --raw --address 192.168.0.42 "*IDN?"

   By default raw/TCP port 5555 is used but it can be changed using the
   --raw-port <port> option.

   Warning: Using raw/TCP is faster than VXI11 but does not provide any
   timeout/control mechanisms so if your command somehow stalls it will
   stall forever.

 * Use new lxi_connect() function

 * Cleanup

 * Make screenshot filename optional

   In case no screenshot filename is provided the tool will write the
   screenshot image to an automatically resolved and incremented filename
   on the form screenshot-###.<format>. For example, screenshot-000.png,
   screenshot-001.png, etc.

 * Improve screenshot model listing

 * Increase default timeout for screenshot command

   Transferring screenshot image data takes time so lets increase the
   timeout so we do not easily interrupt a good but slow transfer.

 * Collapse Rigol screenshot plugin

   Support all Rigol oscilloscope models via one model name.

 * Add screenshot support for Keysight IV 2000 X

 * Cleanup plugins

 * Add screenshot support for R&S HMO1000 series

 * Add screenshot support for Rigol 2000/4000

 * Create directory for screenshot plugins



Changes since lxi-tools v1.4:

 * Remove -Og flag

   Not supported by older gcc versions.

 * Fix various bugs in script and interactive mode



Changes since lxi-tools v1.3:

 * Add screenshot feature to lxi tool

   The old rigol_1000z_screenshot tool is retired in favor of a screenshot feature
   in the lxi tool. A new lxi command 'screenshot' is added and also a small
   screenshot plugin framework which makes it easy to add new screenshot plugins
   for new instruments.

   Currently there is only a screenshot plugin for Rigol 1000Z series
   oscilloscopes.

 * Update README



Changes since lxi-tools v1.2:

 * Added AUTHORS file

 * Use new lxi_connect() function
