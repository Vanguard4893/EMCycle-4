	The PC transfer set consists of the following:
	
		* 2 bidirectional, plastic fiber optical cable, 
		  2 m and 20 m long
		* 1 fiber optical adapter, ORSD-9 universal
		* 1 adapter from 9-pin submin. D to 25-pin submin. D
		* 1 MS-DOS diskette (3.5") with the following files:
		    - README.TXT (a quick summary)
		    - EMR\PCT_DOC.TXT (this text, documentation on the
		      PC transfer set)
		    - EMR\EMR_PCT.TRM (configuration file for the Windows 
		      accessory program 'Terminal')
		    - EMR\PROBES\*.* (a configuration utility for the EMR
		      family)			 
		    - EFA\*.*(How to use the PC transfer set with
		      the EFA family)
		
   
	The fiber optical adapter converts the electrical signals from 
	the serial, bidirectional interface used in the EMR devices 
	into electrical RS-232 signals. The adapter is powered by the 
	PC; no additional power supply is necessary. When connected to 
	a PC, the adapter must be set to 'DTE'. If the serial interface 
	of the PC has a 25-pin connector instead of a 9-pin one, use 
	the adapter included here.

	The data format of the interface is 4800 baud, 1 start bit, 
	8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. For the protocol,
	XON/XOFF should be set. Data are transmitted and received
	as ASCII characters.

	
	Quick-start with Microsoft Windows 3.1 or WfW 3.11:
	***************************************************

	If you use Microsoft Windows, you can get a quick overview of 
	the remote control capabilities of the EMR family. First, start 
	up the Windows accessory known as "Terminal". Then load the 
	configuration file EMR_PCT.TRM found on this diskette. If you 
	plan to make regular use of the terminal program for con-
	trolling your EMR device, then copy the file EMR_PCT.TRM onto 
	your hard disk. This will not change your Windows installation. 
	If and when you no longer need the configuration file, just 
	erase it. Your computer will then be restored to its original 
	state.
	
	If the transfer set is connected to the COM 2 port, you can get
	started immediately once EMR_PCT.TRM is loaded. If you use 
	another port, you will have to configure the terminal program 
	accordingly. Using the function keys in the terminal program, 
	you can then control almost the entire range of remote control
	functions of the EMR family.
	
	The labelling on the function keys should be self-explanatory. 
	When you click on a function key, you will see the command text 
	which is transmitted to the EMR device. Any possible re-
	sponse(s) from the EMR device will be displayed in the 
	following line(s).

	Please note that you can use a total of four levels of function
	keys. Access the different levels by clicking on the key to the
	right of the function keys. This shifts the function keys by 
	one level.

	Tip:
	
	You can use measurement results gathered with the Terminal 
	program in other Windows applications as long as they are 
	capable of processing numerical data in text format. Just 
	mark the results with the mouse and copy them to the Windows 
	buffer. You can then access these results from other 
	applications (until you copy other data into the buffer). 
	We suggest that you call up the editor included with the 
	Windows accessories as soon as you leave the Terminal program 
	and store the data in a file.

	Another way to store measurement data in a text file is to write 
	the receiving data directly in to a text file. While writing to a 
	text file no function keys can be used. See the help file of the
	terminal program for more details.  
	  

	If you want to use "Excel" to process the data, you have to 
	let Excel know that, in case of three-channel data, the columns
	are separated by a comma. Also, the number format must be set
	to recognize "." as the decimal point. There should not be any
	separator for the "thousands" place. One way to do this is using 
	the Windows control panel.


	Command language:
	*****************

	The device is controlled using commands based on SCPI. Commands
	must be terminated with 'LF'. A 'CR' is optional before the
	'LF'. No distinction is made between upper and lower case. 
	Output strings are terminated with 'CR LF'.

	It is good practice to use a garbage collector for the data strings 
	received from the EMR instruments. The following signs should be 
	deleted before further processing: blanks, CR, LF, DC1 and DC3
	(in decimal: 32, 13, 10, 17, 19). 


	In the description of the commands, the following nomenclature
	is used:

	[?] an optional '?' is used to query the parameter settings

	<X> angled brackets enclose a transmission parameter X
	!!! the parameter must be separated from the preceeding text 
	by a blank !!!

	/   a slash separates possible alternative entries

	{ } an abbreviated form of commands is given in curly brackets 

	*******************************************************************
	!!! You should use only those commands which are listed here.
	There exist a few other commands which are intended only for 
	the production test shop and for the service department at 
	Wandel & Goltermann. !!!
	*******************************************************************

	*IDN?           
		Returns a string with the company name, device name,
		serial number and version number of the device 
		software.

	SYST:BEEP               {BP}
		The device outputs a beep.

	SYST:ERR?               {SE}
		An error message of the command interpreter is queried.
		This can be executed to check whether a command was 
		properly understood.

		0       no error
		-109    missing parameter
		-110    unknown command
		-222    data out of range
		-224    illegal parameter value
		-300    mode error

	SYST:BAT?                
		You can query whether the NiCds or batteries are still
		delivering sufficient voltage:
		BAT_LOW     batteries are low
		BAT_OK      batteries still OK
		!!! If you query this item regularly, there is still 
		enough charge for 15 minutes of operation once the 
		first BAT_LOW is reported. Afterwards, the device 
		shuts off automatically. If the device detects 
		insufficient battery voltage at power-on, then it 
		automatically shuts off during the self-test after 
		outputting an appropriate error message. !!!

	SYST:KLOC <X>        {KLOC <X>}
		The keypad of the basic device can be disabled. When
		disabled, the device beeps if a key is pressed; the key 
		press is otherwise ignored. The ON/OFF key is an 
		exception. You can still power off the device manually 
		even when the keypad is disabled.
		X = ON          Keypad is disabled
		X = OFF         Keypad is enabled
	   
	*******************************************************************
	The following commands work only in measurement mode. In other 
	words, the device must have passed the self-test after power-on
	with no error messages. You can test whether the device is in 
	measurement mode by transmitting one of the following commands, 
	followed by the command SYST:ERR?. If error -300 (mode error) 
	is reported, the device is not in measurement mode.
	*******************************************************************

	MEAS?                   {M}
		A single measured value is output.
		The decimal point is a '.'.
		The length of the output string is constant per output
		unit; leading zeroes lying more than one place to 
		the left of the decimal point are represented as a 
		'BLANK'.
		For a three-channel measurement, the three spatial
		components are output separated by a comma.
		See also the commands CALC:UNIT and CALC:AXIS.

	MEAS:ARRAY? <X>         {MA <X>}
		X measured values are output at intervals ranging from 
		400 ms to 800 ms.
		You can stop outputting measured values with MEAS:STOP. 
		X = 1 to 255

	MEAS:START      {MSTR}
		Continuous output of measured values is initiated. 
		The interval between measured values can range from 
		400 ms to 800 ms.
		Use MEAS:STOP to stop outputting values.

	MEAS:STOP       {MSTP}
		Ends output of measured values which was initiated 
		with MEAS:START or MEAS:ARRAY?.

	CALC:AVER[?] <X>        {AV[?] <X>}   
		Computation of the AVERAGE value can be switched 
		on and off.
		X = ON/OFF
		Averaging can be active at the same time as the MAX 
		function. When this happens, the maximum average value
		is output. See also CALC:MAX. 
		***********************************************************
		!!! When AVERAGE is switched on, measured values are
		output on the serial interface only if the averaging 
		time setting (see also CALC:AVER:TIME) has elapsed since
		the device was switched on or the average memory was
		cleared (see CALC:AVER:CLEAR). When AVERAGE is switched
		on, measured values are output only at intervals of
		4 seconds. !!!
		***********************************************************
	
	CALC:AVER:TIME[?] <X>   {AVT[?] <X>}
		The averaging time can be set with a resolution of
		4 seconds.
		X = 4 to 1000 
		When the device is powered on, X is set equal to 
		360 seconds (6 minutes).

	CALC:AVER:CLEAR         {AVC}
		Use this function to clear the averaging memories 
		(AVERAGE: X,Y,Z and EFF).

	CALC:MAX[?] <X>         {MAX[?] <X>}   
		The maximum value function can be switched on and off.
		X = ON/OFF
		The maximum value function can be active at the same 
		time as the AVERAGE function. When this happens, the 
		maximum average value is output. See also CALC:AVER. 

	CALC:MAX:CLEAR          {MAXC}
		The memories for the maximum value function 
		(MAX: X,Y,Z and EFF and MAX AVERAGE: X,Y,Z and 
		EFF) are cleared.

	CALC:UNIT[?] <X>        {CU[?] <X>}
		The output units for the measured values can be set.
		X = E_Field        E field (V/m)
				   Format XXXXX.XX
		X = H_Field        H field (A/m)
				   Format XXX.XXXX
		X = Power_Dens     Electromagnetic power density 
				   (mW/(cm*cm))
				   Format XXXXXXX.XXXXX
		X = Power_Dens_SI  Electromagnetic power density
				   (W/(m*m))
				   Format XXXXXXXX.XXXX

	CALC:CAL[?] <X>         {CC[?] <X>}
		The CAL factor can be entered.
		X = 0.01 to 99.99
		(display value = CAL factor * measured value)

	CALC:AXIS[?] <X>        {CAX[?] <X>}
		The processing of the three spatial components can be
		set for isotropic probes.
		X = ALL         The display gives the equivalent field
				strength.
				However, the three spatial components
				are output separately on the serial
				interface.
				The order of the spatial components is 
				X, Y and Z. For single-channel probes,
				only the X component is output.
				This setting is always activated after 
				power-on.
		X = EFF         The display as well as the serial
				interface output the equivalent field
				strength.
		X = X/Y/Z       The display as well as the serial
				interface output the selected spatial
				component (X, Y or Z).
		Since the device has a total of 16 memories for the four 
		different averaging modes (ACTUAL, AVERAGE, MAX and 
		MAX & AVERAGE) and spatial components (X, Y, Z  and 
		EFF), setting the averaging mode has the same effect on 
		all settings of CALC:AXIS, i.e. in all cases the 
		average values are computed from actual values of the 
		displayed spatial component.

	CAL:AUTO:ZERO[?] <X>    {AZ[?] <X>}
		Setting of automatic zero alignment.
		X = 0 to 2      reserved, 
				only for W&G testing and service.
		X = ON          zero alignment is executed and is then
				performed from this point onwards
				cyclically at intervals as set with 
				CAL:ZERO:TIME.
		X = OFF         zero alignment is performed once.
		Zero alignment lasts about three seconds. No measured
		values are output during zero alignment. Automatic
		zero alignment is used only to compensate for 
		temperature variations.
		In a lab environment, a single zero alignment is 
		sufficient if the temperature is kept constant to 
		+/- 3 degrees Celsius. The advantage of this is that 
		you can prevent measurements from being interrupted by 
		a zero alignment.

	CAL:ZERO:TIME[?] <X>    {ZT[?] <X>}       
		Setting of the maximum time interval (minutes) at 
		which automatic zero alignment is performed.
		X = 2 to 60   in steps of 1
		After power-on, X is always set equal to 6 (6 minutes).
		 
	
	*******************************************************************
	The following commands work only with device software version 2.00 
	or higher (see command *IDN?). This software runs only on newer
	devices. A software update for older devices is not possible.
	*******************************************************************

	FAST:MODE[?] <X>
		Sets the instrument to an mode which is optimized for
		fast remote control but dissables serveral functions.
		This mode is very usefull for automated measurements in
		EMC laboratories.
 		X = ON/OFF	Default ist OFF 
		With X = ON the time intervall between measured values is
		constantly 400ms if the commands MEAS:ARRAY? or MEAS:START
		are used. No data are lost. 
		The response time for the command MEAS? is improved.
		On the other hand all averaging or max hold is frozen. 
		The returned measured values are actual values. 
		The limit value is no longer surveyed. No keyboard inter-
		upts are serviced. The display is frozen and shows FAST.The
		automatic zero alignment is done one time when entering 
		FAST:MODE and is then dissabled until leaving the 
		FAST:MODE. The calculation unit is set to the base unit of
		the probe. The axis calculation is set to effectiv field
		strength. When leaving FAST:MODE the previous settings are 
		restored. 

	SYST:DEFAULTS	
		Restores the power up state and dissables all averaging and
		max hold functions. Returns the device id (like *IDN?) and 
		the actual calculation unit (like CALC:UNITS?, in this
		case always the base unit of the probe) 
 		

	SYST:PROBES? <X1 Y1>
			"		     
		     <XN YN>
		Returns the probe type number X and the probes serial
		number Y for every probe that is known to the device.
		There may be me data for N = 1 ..7 probes.
		You may only use probes with correct type number and serial
		number,because the calibration data are stored in the 
		device and not in the probe.

 		Y = month ( 01 to 12)
		Z = day (01 to 31)

	MEM? 		
		Returns the number of data (0 to 1500) stored in the
